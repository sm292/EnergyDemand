The columns in the dataset are:

 - SETTLEMET_DATA: date in format dd/mm/yyyy
 - SETTLEMENT_PERIOD: half hourly period for the historic outtunr occurred
 - ND (National Demand). National Demand is the sum of metered generation, but excludes generation required to meet station load, pump storage pumping and interconnector exports. National Demand is calculated as a sum of generation based on National Grid ESO operational generation metering. Measured in MW.
 - TSD (Transmission System Demand). Transmission System Demand is equal to the ND plus the additional generation required to meet station load, pump storage pumping and interconnector exports. Measured in MW.
 - ENGLAND_WALES_DEMAND. England and Wales Demand, as ND above but on an England and Wales basis. Measured in MW.
 - EMBEDDED_WIND_GENERATION. This is an estimate of the GB wind generation from wind farms which do not have Transmission System metering installed. These wind farms are embedded in the distribution network and invisible to National Grid ESO. Their effect is to suppress the electricity demand during periods of high wind. The true output of these generators is not known so an estimate is provided based on National Grid ESO’s best model. Measured in MW.
 - EMBEDDED_WIND_CAPACITY. This is National Grid ESO’s best view of the installed embedded wind capacity in GB. This is based on publicly available information compiled from a variety of sources and is not the definitive view. It is consistent with the generation estimate provided above. Measured in MW
 - EMBEDDED_SOLAR_GENERATION. This is an estimate of the GB solar generation from PV panels. These are embedded in the distribution network and invisible to National Grid ESO. Their effect is to suppress the electricity demand during periods of high radiation. The true output of these generators is not known so an estimate is provided based on National Grid ESO’s best model. Measured in MW.
 - EMBEDDED_SOLAR_CAPACITY. As embedded wind capacity above, but for solar generation. Measured in MW.
 - NON_BM_STOR (Non-Balancing Mechanism SHort-Term Operating Reserve). For units that are not included in the ND generator definition. This can be in the form of generation or demand reduction. Measured in MW.
 - PUMP_STORAGE_PUMPING. The demand due to pumping at hydro pump storage units; the -ve signifies pumping load.
 - IFA_FLOW (IFA Interconnector Flow). The flow on on the respective interconnector. -ve signifies export power out from GB; +ve signifies import power into GB. Measured in MW.
 - IFA2_FLOW (IFA Interconnector Flow). The flow on the respective interconnector. -ve signifies export power out from GB; +ve signifies import power into GB. Measured in MW.
 - MOYLE_FLOW (Moyle Interconnector FLow). The flow on the respective interconnector. -ve signifies export power out from GB; +ve signifies import power into GB. Measured in MW.
 - EAST_WEST_FLOW (East West Innterconnector FLow). The flow on the respective interconnector. -ve signifies export power out from GB; +ve signifies import power into GB. Measured in MW.
 - NEMO_FLOW (Nemo Interconnector FLow). The flow on the respective interconnector. -ve signifies export power out from GB; +ve signifies import power into GB. Measured in MW.
 - NSL_FLOW (North Sea Link Interconnector Flow). The flow on the respective interconnector. -ve signifies export power out from GB; +ve signifies import power into GB. Measured in MW.
 - ELCLINK_FLOW. Blank
